# To-Do List Application

This is a Python-based To-Do List application designed to help you manage your tasks effectively. The application allows you to add, delete, and view tasks in a simple command-line interface.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **`todo.py`**:
   - The main script that runs the To-Do List application.
   - Handles the core functionality, including adding, deleting, and viewing tasks.

2. **`module.py`**:
   - Contains helper functions that are used in the `todo.py` script.
   - Provides modularity and keeps the main script clean and organized.

3. **`module.cpython-312.pyc`**:
   - The compiled Python file, automatically generated from `module.py`. This file is used for optimization purposes by Python.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Run the To-Do List application**:
   ```bash
   python todo.py
   ```

3. **Follow the on-screen instructions**:
   - **Add a task**: Enter the task description when prompted.
   - **Delete a task**: Select the task number to delete it from the list.
   - **View tasks**: The current list of tasks will be displayed on the screen.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all current tasks in a simple list format.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The core programming language used to develop the application.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The application runs in a terminal or command prompt, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier task management.
- Add the ability to set due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Include task prioritization and categorization.
